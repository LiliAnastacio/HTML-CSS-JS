# HTML-CSS-JS
First repository to add my work on HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This website is a version of my very first website using these languages (responsive one) 

The idea is to improve and create as many versions as possible to test and see all the possibilities.

Tips and insights are more than welcome because I want to learn and become an awesome dev!
